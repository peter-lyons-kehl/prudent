    # Cargo.toml has "rust-version" (MSRV) 1.31. But, 1.37 is the oldest Alpine docker image. See
    # https://hub.docker.com/_/rust/tags?name=alpine&ordering=-last_updated.
    #
    # rust:1.37-alpine was failing some GitHub's extra checks:
    # https://github.com/peter-lyons-kehl/prudent/actions/runs/18773758118/job/53563574851
    #
    # Other Rust Alpine images that I've tried and they failed: rust:1.54.0-alpine.
    #
    # Also, our tests use usize::unchecked_add, which was stabilized in Rust 1.79.
    container: rust:1.79-alpine
